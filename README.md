# Hospital-data

Our project focuses on web scraping to extract specific information from various hospital websites in and around Coimbatore. We've gathered data from three hospitals: Sri Ramakrishna, KMCH, and Sheela Hospital. This information is organized as dictionaries within a JSON file, enabling efficient retrieval and display of required details for users.

Initially, users have two options:

-Search by Hospitals: Users can select a hospital of interest and view the available doctors.

-Search by Specialities: Users can choose a medical specialty, and the system will display doctors across different hospitals who specialize in that field.

When opting to search by hospitals, users select a specific hospital and are then presented with a list of doctors practicing there. Conversely, when searching by specialities, a list of medical specialties is shown for the user to choose from. After selecting a specialty, the system displays doctors from different hospitals who specialize in that particular field.
